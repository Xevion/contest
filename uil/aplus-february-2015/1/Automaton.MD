# Automaton

Run my solution on **[repl.it](https://repl.it/@Xevion/A-Computer-Science-February-2015-Automaton)!**

A rather simple problem, despite the overwhelming complicated background information to understand what it's talking about in the first paragraph.

I recommend skipping the first paragraph, and simply looking at the second one very carefully. In short, the entire problem is basically Regex.

All you have to do is manipulate the input data, create a function for matching, loop until you find a input that works, and you're done.

There was one big problem though I encountered, one that would have been a failed submission in the end.
