# Study

Questions I missed, things I need to pay attention to, study, or otherwise practice. All of these are curated from both online resources and my own experiences.

While I may claim most of these to be right, and it should, make sure to research and confirm anything you wish to take from this file.

If you find something incorrect, feel free to contribute and modify.

## All concepts

### Compound Assignment Operators

```java
int x = 12;
// x = x + (int)2.6;
x += 2.6;
```

Compound assignment operators effectively cast *before assigning values* to the specified variables.

### Octal Literals

Octal Literals are defined by a zero prefix.

```
012 + 021 = ?
012 = 8 + 2 = 10
021 = 16 + 1 = 17
10 + 17 = 27
```

Decimal literals are defined in traditional form, 0-9 in base 10.

Hexadecimal literals are defined with the *case insensitive* character set `a-fA-F0-9` and prefixed with `0x` or `0X`.

`0xFace = 61440 + 2560 + 192 + 14 = 64206`

Binary literals are defined with a `0b` or `0B` prefix.

`0b10101 = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21`

### Return Types

Check **return type** of methods! Pretty simple, but easy to miss when speeding through a test.

### Binary Trees

Become familiar with how Binary Search Trees are created, and how one can manipulate them to create and level of elements.

More specifically, how many levels can a 32 element tree have if maximized?

Additionally, the concepts below should be studied and memorized for maximum effect.

* Min Heap
    * Every node's child nodes are greater or equal to itself (i.e. smaller nodes higher up).
    * Binary Tree is complete.
* Max Heap
    * Every node's child nodes are less than or equal to itself (i.e. greater nodes higher up).
    * Binary Tree is complete.
* Complete Trees
    *  Every level is filled (no null/empty spaces) except for the last, which has all nodes as far to the left as possible.
* Perfect Trees
    * Every internal node has two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
        * The binary tree will look like a triangle at every height.
        * The tree will contain `(2 ^ h) - 1` nodes.
* Full Trees
    * Also known as a "Proper Binary Tree" or "2-tree" or "Strict Tree".
    * A tree where every node other than the Leaf Nodes has at least 2 has two children.
* Balanced Trees
    * A binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.
    * To determine if a binary tree is unbalanced, find a node where the subtree on the left or right is two levels deeper (or 'shallower') than the other.
* Binary Search Tree (BST) Trees
    * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
    * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
    * The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
* Child Node
    * Self explanatory, a node to the bottom left or right of a parent node. Child nodes traditionally do not include child nodes of child nodes, which is is instead referred to as a "subtree" or "grandchild node".
* Leaf Node
    * A node where the left and right child nodes are null or empty.
    * Can be spotted usually at the "bottom" of the tree, or "farthest" from the root node.

### String.split Trailing Strings

String.split will create empty strings, but trailing empty strings will not be included in the final array. Additionally, a integer can be appended to define a limit to the number of "splits" that will occur.

```java
out.println("xxOOxx".split("x"));
> ["", "", "00"]
out.println("xxx".split("x"));
> ["", "", ""]
out.println("xx0x0x0x".split("x"));
> ["", "", "0", "0", "0"]
out.println("xx0x0x0x".split("x", 3));
> ["", "", "0", "0x0x"]
```

### Java's Primary Four OOP Concepts

* Abstraction
    * Complex objects are given relatively simple forms. Complex code is hidden within a much simpler face. Code is rewritten less. Very similar to Encapsulation.
    ```java
    class Maze {
        // Contains few overloaded public methods, but many complex private methods.
        // Most of these methods wouldn't be easy to document the purpose of 
        // to project inactive developers thus they are made private for
        // user simplification.
        public Image render()
        public Image render(int x, int y)
        public void progress()
        public void progress(int steps)
        public void finish()
        private Node getNeighbors(int x, int y)
        private Node[] pathBetween(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
        private Node[] pathBetween(Node start, Node end)
        private void initialize(boolean restart)
    }
    ```
* Encapsulation
    * Fields are kept private. Getters and Setters are used to access values within objects. The primary purpose is to make sure values that are not intended to be modified are not modified without the developer's explicit intention. See below for a example showing how money must be regulated before being added to a Student's account.
    ```java
    class Student extends Person {
        private double lunchMoney;
        public double addLunchMoney(int value) {return this.addLunchMoney((double)value)}
        public double addLunchMoney(double value) {
            assert value >= 0.0 : "You cannot add negative money to a Student's account!";
            value = value * 100
            this.lunchMoney += round(value, 2); // Nothing
        }
        private double round(int val, int places) {
            return ((int) val * Math.pow(10, places)) / Math.pow(10, places);
        }
    }
    ```
* Inheritance
    * Classes can use features and attributes from previously defined classes so as to not repeat code, and add unique, customized implementations of code quickly. What could be a extraordinarily large, nearly impossible to maintain codebase, can be simplified using Inheritance and a standardized style of implementation (i.e. `super` is expected to always work in a certain way even post modification).
    ```java
    class Organism
    class Animal extends Organism
    class Bipedal extends Animal
    class Ape extends Bipedal
    class Human extends Ape
    class Person extends Human
    class HumanChild extends Person
    class HumanAdult extends Person
    class BlueCollarWorker extends HumanAdult implements Worker
    class WhiteCollarWorker extends HumanAdult implements Worker
    class SoftwareEngineer extends WhiteCollarWorker implements Worker, Engineer
    ```
* Polymorphism
    * The ability for an object to take many forms. Most commonly used when a `parent class reference` is used to refer to a `child class object`.
        *   ```java
            Deer d = new Deer();
            Animal a = d;
            Vegetarian v = d;
            Object o = d;
            ```
    * Includes Method Overloading and Method Overriding, Inheritance by extension.
        * Method Overloading
            * A method may perform differently based on how it is called (i.e. different return type given different arguments).
            ```java
            int calculate(int val)
            double calculate(int val)
            double calculate(int val, int limit)
            ```
        * Method Overriding
            * Uses Polymorphism to *override* the functionality of a parent class's methods.
            ```java
            class Person {
                void live() {e}
                void tick() {
                    this.live()
                }
            }

            class Student extends Person {
                void study() {}
                void tick() {
                    this.study()
                    super.tick(); // Calls Person.tick()
                }
            }
            ```

### Abstraction vs Encapsulation

I've noticed that Abstraction and Encapsulation look *very* similar, and looking it up, it seems it's pretty common to mix it up.

![Abstraction vs Encapsulation Diagram by "zaynali53"](https://i.imgur.com/LzTH3qu.png)

I would mostly pay attention to what it looks like, more than truly understanding it. Tests will more likely show code with `Interface/Abstract Class` and ask you to determine what OOP Concept is being demonstrated, rather than a complex concept example.

### Other important OOP concepts 

* Coupling
    * Refers to how tightly or loosely two objects depend on or use eachother.
        * Tight Coupling 
            * For example, a tightly coupled relationship, a Human and his/her Heart, they are highly dependent on eachother to continue life.
            ```java
            class Human {
                private Heart heart;
                
                Human(int age) {
                    this.heart = new Heart(age);
                }
            }

            class Heart {
                Heart(int age) {}
            }
            ```
            * I'd believe the most likely thing you want to look for is a object within an object, especially one with methods that seem to  'pair' the two objects to eachother.
                * If you tried to implement the second object within a different outer class, how much code would have to change to handle this larger usability?
        * Loose Coupling
          
            * For example, a Teacher and a Student. Interactions between these two objects can be observed as infrequently as one desires, to the point where one can exist without the other.

### Bad AP practices

Some practices are likely to earn a more detailed inspection of the code than others, some stand out more, essentially. Here's a short compilation of what practices most likely win in this regard...

#### Why?

Grading of Handwritten code is more difficult and harder to do, as it can't be quickly verified to work, and since real life implementation of code is much more messy (no one writes perfect code the first time), it's probably a good thing AP graders are not going to grade Free Responses with perfect accuracy.

The take-away from this is essentially: write the most boring code, conform to the standards, don't be special. Graders will be seeing a million tests that look all the same, and they won't be able to dedicate their time to each and every problem. Looking like all the others can only help you when you make a tiny mistake.

In fact, it's likely that aspiring Software Engineers will want to get used to this treatment for the future, as writing code that is easy to understand is far more valuable than code that no one can understand (even if it works a little better in the short run).

#### Guidelines

* Ternary Operators
  
    * Ternary Operators are a uncommon operator, and while AP test graders should know of it, it might be better to retreat to a much simpler `if else` statement in the long run.
* Variable Names
    * Try to decipher what most people would likely name a variable from the prompt.
    * If the prompt says "number of days passed", you should write `int daysPassed`, but not `int DAYSPASSED`, or `double daysGONEby` and so forth.
* Good Handwriting
    * Bad handwriting requires more attention when grading, attempt to write cleaner so as to reduce the time graders spend looking at your paper.
    * Make sure your lines are straight across the paper, and do not slant haphazardly.
    * Write somewhat large. Not excessively large, but larger than one would do for Essays in English and other writing assignments. Gauge how much room you need to answer the Free Response and write in a size accordingly.
    * APCentral has actually released a example of good penmanship, seen below.
    ![APCentral Penmanship Example](https://i.imgur.com/mx1PP73.gif)
* Bracketing Style
    * When writing brackets, follow this format (I may not be following this format in the rest of this file, sorry).
    ```java
    class File
    {
        private String path;
        File(String path)
        {
            this.path = path;
        }

        void print()
        {
            // print the file
        }
    }
    ```

### Most Common Imports

```java
import static java.lang.System.out;
> out.println("shorthand println");
import java.io.File; // Read and Write files
> File input = new File("input1.dat"); // can be thrown directly into a Scanner's input
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
> public static void main(String[] args ) throws FileNotFoundException {
import java.util.Scanner;
> Scanner s = new Scanner();
> s.nextInt();
> s.hasNextInt();
> s.nextLine();
import java.util.Arrays;
> Arrays.toString(new int[]{});
```

### Declare, Instantiate, Initialize

* Declaration: The code set in bold are all variable declarations that associate a variable name with an object type.
    ```java
        type name;
        int age;
        double magnitude;
        Point origin;
    ```
* Instantiation: The new keyword is a Java operator that creates the object.
    ```java
        Point origin = new Point();
    ```
    * Initialization: The new operator is followed by a call to a constructor, which initializes the new object. Instantiation and Initialization almost always occur on the same line, in the same instant.
    ```java
    class Point
    {
        private int x;
        private int y;
        Point(int x, int y)    <--- Initalization
        {                      <---      is
            this.x = x;        <---   occurring
            this.y = y;        <---     right
        }                      <---     here
    }
    ```

### Default Array Values

#### Primitive Arrays

[Try it yourself](https://repl.it/@Xevion/PrimitiveArrayNullOrZero) at [repl.it](https://repl.it/)

#### ArrayList Arrays

### When Primitive Array Casts Are Required

Primitive Arrays can be declared and initialized in all these ways.

```java
int[] myIntArray = new int[3];
int[] myIntArray = {1, 2, 3};
int[] myIntArray = new int[]{1, 2, 3};
```

Option 3 may seem rather extraneous to the Java language, but it actually has a very specific purpose.

```java
static String[] method() {
    return {"Method1", "Method2", "Method3"};
}
```
will not compile, as the compiler expects a type for primitive array literals.

```java
static String[] method2() {
    return new String[]{"Method1", "Method2", "Method3"};
}
```

It also expects a `new`, not just `String[]` before the *literal* part of a literal array definition.
