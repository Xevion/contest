# Collections

Java contains many object based data structures, some sorted, some limited, some simple, some complex.

Not all of them work in familiar ways, and their methods can be confusing without proper usage, study, and a quick explanation over how they're used.

This page will be using [javaTpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/collections-in-java) for sources regarding all interfaces and classes referenced in this file.

## Hierarchy of Collection Framework

All datastructures referenced here can be imported using `import java.util.<structure>;`, or just `import java.util.*;` (I recommend making more direct import statements as a 'good practice' but it does not matter in the end).

Since all classes discussed onward inherit the `Collections` interface, you can be sure that a valid, working implementation exists for every single one of these methods.

However, the real power comes from the next set of interfaces, and the special methods devised by each class to manipulate these complex data structures.

## Interfaces

### Iterator Interface

### Iterable Interface

The Iterable interface is the root interface for all the collection classes. The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface and therefore all the subclasses of Collection interface also implement the Iterable interface.

It contains only one abstract method, `Iterator<T> iterator()` which returns the `Iterator` object used to iterate over the elements of the datastructure (type `T`).

### Collection Interface

The Collection interface is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the collection framework. It declares the methods that every collection will have. In other words, we can say that the Collection interface builds the foundation on which the collection framework depends.

All methods the Collection interface implements can be seen [here](#methods-of-the-collection-interface).

### List Interface

List interface is the child interface of Collection interface. It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection of objects. Lists can have duplicate values.

List interface is implemented by the classes [ArrayList](#arraylist-class), [LinkedList](#linkedlist-class), [Vector](#vector-class), and [Stack](#stack-class).

Remember, that *as a Interface*, `List<T>`s cannot be instantiated, but can be used to type any of the implementing classes. For example:

```java
List<Integer> list; 
list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
list = new LinkedList<Integer>();
list = new Stack<Integer>();
list = new Vector<Integer>();
```

### Queue Interface

A Queue implements a basic first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. It is a ordered list (based on the order of insertion, not by 'value') which typically holds items that are in waiting list to be processed.

Queue interface is implemented by the classes (and interfaces) [PriorityQueue](#priorityqueue-class), [Deque](#deque-interface), and [ArrayDeque](#arraydeque-class).

```java
Queue<Integer> q;
q = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
q = new ArrayDeque<Integer>(); // Deque Interface is an extension of Queue
```

### Deque Interface

An extension of the [Queue](#queue-interface) Interface, the Deque can remove and add elements from both sides of the list. It stands for *double-ended queue* (addition and removal ops can be done on both sides).

Side note: Deque is pronounced like Deck (i.e. a deck of cards), not like DQ (Dee-Cue) as might be interpreted based on it's underlying meaning.

Deque is implemented in the class [ArrayDeque](#arraydeque-class)

```java
Deque<String> d = new ArrayDeque<String>();
```

### Set Interface

A Set is a unordered list of elements with one basic principle different - all items are unique, duplicate elements are not allowed.

While `null` values are allowed in Sets, the element distinction rule is passed on to `null` values too, and thus at most only one can be in a Set at any time.

Set is implemented by [HashSet](#hashset-class), [LinkedHashSet](#linkedhashset-class), and [TreeSet](#treeset-class).

```java
Set<Double> s;
s = new HashSet<Double>();
s = new LinkedHashSet<Double>();
s = new TreeSet<Double>();
```

### SortedSet Interface

## Classes

### ArrayList Class

ArrayList uses a dynamically sized array.

See [ArrayList vs Vector](#arraylist-vs-vector).

### LinkedList Class

### Vector Class

Vector uses a dynamically sized array to store the data elements, with a functionality most similar to the [ArrayList Class](#arraylist-class)

- Synchronized (Thead Safe, Multi-user Application)

- Uses [Iterator](#iterator-interface) or Enumeration interface for element traversal

See [ArrayList vs Vector](#arraylist-vs-vector).

### Stack Class

### PriorityQueue Class

### ArrayDeque Class

### HashSet Class

### LinkedHashSet Class

### TreeSet Class

## Similarities and Differences

### ArrayList vs Vector

### HashSet vs TreeSet vs LinkedHashSet

## Tips and Tricks

### Datatype Conversion

To convert from Primitive Arrays to Object-based ArrayLists, Stacks or Queues, use `Arrays.asList(T[])`.

It returns a *fixed-size* `List<T>` that directly modifies the entries of the original Array, so be careful.

Most people feed this directly into a new `ArrayList` in order to avoid overwriting data, as well as to take advantage of ArrayList features (dynamically resizing).
